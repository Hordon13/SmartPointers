## The task

Our task was to read information from a file containing points of a 3D object and project this image onto a 2D plane.</br>
For this used perspective projection. We had to take into consideration the size of the object and the position, angle and field of view of the camera.</br>
We have received a few test examples, on the following images you can see the results: </br>

As a nice addition you are capable of rotating the object around one of the planes and visualizing the result in 2D by utilizing the OpenCV library. This functionality can be found on the SmartOpenCV branch to separate it from the core task. On the following .gif you can see the rotation in action: </br>
